//* WE USE CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION FOR CREATING OBJECTS USING A FUNCTION.
//* CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION IS JUST COMPLETELY A SIMPLE FUNCTION, THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE CALL CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION WITH THE NEW OPERATOR.
//* THERE IS A CONVENTION THAT WE START CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION WITH THE CAPITAL LETTER.
//* THE ARROW FUNCTION WILL NOT WORK AS A FUNCTION CONSTRUCTOR, BCZ IT DOESN'T HAVE THIER OWN "this" KEYWORD.

const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {};

new Person("Abuzar", 2001);
//* THE "new" KEYWORD IS A VERY SPECIAL TYPE OF KEYWORD, BCZ IT CALL THE ABOVE (PERSON) FUNCTION

//? FOUR STEPS HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES, WHEN WE WRITE THE "new" KEYWORD.
//* A NEW EMPTY OBJECT{} IS CREATED.
//* THE FUNCTION IS CALLED, THE "this" KEYWORD WILL BE SET TO THE NEWLY CREATED OBJECT.
//* IN THE EXECUTION CONTEXT OF THE PERSON FUNCTION, THE "this" KEYWORD WILL POINT THE OBJECT THAT WAS CREATED.
//* OBJECT IS LINKED TO PROTOTYPE.
//* FUNCTION AUTOMATICALLY RETURNS THAT EMPTY OBJECT FROM THE BEGINNING.
